# Time Series Data

One of the most important concept of Data Science is to be able to analyze and forecast time series data.

The main file called `arima_forecasting.R` is from ('https://www.datascience.com/blog/introduction-to-forecasting-with-arima-in-r-learn-data-science-tutorials').

Eventually, I will be creating my own stock price analysis here since I am very interested in the performance of these models.

#### Important Concepts:

* Seasonality - Fluctuations in the data related to calendar cycles
* Trend - Overall pattern of the series
* Cycle - Decreasing or Increasing patterns that are not seasonal

#### Stationarity 
* ADF - Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test is a formal statistical test for stationarity.  
* AcF - Autocorrelation Plots determines whether a series is stationary
* Pacf - Partial Autocorrelation Plots 


## Getting Started

Basic cloning of repository,

`git clone https://github.com/jjneojiajun/time_series_data.git`

### Running the code 

This is a R-Script, this meant that you can either Ctrl-A (Windows) or Command-A (Mac) and run the script or do it step by step.

You need R-Studio and R to be able to run the R File. 

## Built With

* [R](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web framework used
* [R Studio](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
